# McKinney Public Library Foundation: Donor and Grant Tracking

Welcome to the official repository for the McKinney Public Library Foundation (MPLF) Donor and Grant Tracking Application.

This project was developed through the UT Dallas EPICS program to help MPLF efficiently manage donor information, grant applications, and track funding over time.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conceptual Overview

The MPLF Tracking System is designed to:

- Store and manage information about donors, grants, and users.
- Allow staff to log donations and grant requests.
- Provide a secure, role-based access system.
- Offer a simple interface for non-technical users.

## ðŸ‘¥ Users & Roles

| Role         | Permissions                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main Admin   | Full access. Manage all data, assign roles.                                |
| Admin        | Add/edit/delete donors, grants, users. Cannot assign roles.                |
| Editor       | Add/edit donors and grants. Cannot delete or manage users.                 |
| Viewer       | View-only access. Cannot create, edit, or delete records.                  |

Roles are enforced on both frontend and backend. For more details, see the [Roles Wiki Page](https://github.com/UTDallasEPICS/mckinney-library-foundation/wiki/User-Roles).

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: (TBD)

---

## ðŸ§© Third Party Integrations

Currently, no external services are fully integrated. The codebase is structured to allow:

- Future integration with authentication providers (e.g., Auth0 or Clerk)
- Expansion into external donation platforms
