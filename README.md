Conceptual Overview
what is the project intended to accomplish? Include a broad description of the different types of users/roles and what they do.

Functional Requirements
- (broken down by page) - what are the discrete operations the app needs to be capable of?

Third Party Integrations

Tech Stacks
Include frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
Include backend framework (Express.js, etc.)
If you use a meta framework, where the frontend and backend are combined, then you do not need to differentiate between frontend and backend (Next, Nuxt, Sveltekit, etc.)
Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
Other important packages (UI plugins, database connectors like prisma)
Other tools used/needed (such as Postman)

Deployment Notes

Migration Scripts

Instructions for Setting up Development Environment
Assume that the needed software is already installed (Node.js, Docker, etc.).
How do you start your project?
How do you initialize the database?
How do you set up authentication?
Etc.
